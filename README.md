# scalesque
## A scala inspired functional programming library written in c&#35;

scalesque is currently *under construction* and the API is unstable.  I wrote scalesque to make working with c# a bit easier for me. 

### Features list

* Option&lt;T&gt; (aka Maybe&lt;T&gt;)
* Either&lt;T,U&gt;
* Pattern matching and extraction
* Map / Fold / Reduce (via IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)
* Partial function application
* Scalaz inspired validations

## Dependencies

.net 3.5 or 4.0

## License

scalesque is licensed under the MIT license, see license.txt for details.

## Nuget package

Usually in synch with head of master

## Roadmap
* I'm working on the [Documentation](http://noelkennedy.github.com/scalesque)
* Maybe will do Future&lt;T&gt; or Lazy&ltT&gt;
