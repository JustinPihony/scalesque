      <h3>Give me some options people</h3>
      <p>There are a number of ways of creating an instance of Option&lt;T&gt;, or precisely, an instance of Some&lt;T&gt; or None&lt;T&gt; as Option&lt;T&gt; is abstract.</p>
      <h4>apply()</h4>
      <p>Scattered throughout scalesque you will find methods called apply.  You can think of these as factory methods or proxies for constructors.  In Scala, apply methods allow syntactic sugar, but in c# they are just methods like any other.  I have stuck with the Scala naming convention</p>
      <p>There is a static class called Option with method called apply with this signature: Option&lt;T&gt; apply&lt;T&gt;(T value).  It returns an instance of Some&lt;T&gt; or None&lt;T&gt; based on whether T is null.</p>
      <p>Alternately there are two other static methods on Option, Some&ltT&gt;(T value), and None().  It is left as an exercise for the reader to check what these methods do.</p>

      <h4>Dealing with libraries that cost you $1bn</h4>
      <p>As of time of writing, not all libraries in the .net ecosystem use scalesque.  This means that you need to defend yourself against null injection attacks.</p>
      <p>If you know that a method call can return null, if you call .Opt() the object reference it returns, scalesque will return you an Option&ltT&gt; and will handle the conversion to Some&lt;T&gt; or None&lt;T&gt; for you.</p>
      <p>Scalesque also provides extension methods for known bad guys in the .net base library, like Dictionary.</p>
      
      <h4>'Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through! Better get outta his way!'</h4>
      <p>In case you need a bit more convincing about Option&lt;T&gt;, please study the following carefully to see how much easier it is to code with this concept than the alternatives.</p>

		<h4>Next up</h4>
		<p>Unfortunately, we are going to stick with Option&ltT&gt; for the next section, which, as they say, is under construction.  Count yourself lucky as we have had several pages on functional programming and I haven't even mentioned monads yet....Woops!</p>
